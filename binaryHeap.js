/**
 * @name - Binary Heap
 * @description - A heap can be used in any algorithm where sorting or ordering is important. It is commonly used in priority queues. Heaps have a few issues with Lookup - O(n) becasue it doesn't sort like the Binary Search Tree. It is almost like a LinkedList when it comes to search. As long as the lower level is less than the higher level.
 * 
 * @argument - Binary Heaps are really great at doing compaison operations. Just like saying I was people with a value over 33; in a Heap with 
 *                101
 *               | ^ |
 *               76   33
 *             | ^ | | ^ |
 *             2  45 5   1
 * 
 * In this case we can just grab the values at the top 2 levels without the need to go through the entire Heap.

 * 
 * Memory Heap != Heap data Structure
 * - Memory is just storage for the use by language runtimes vs a Heap data structure that we implement for other purposes.
 * 
 * # Priority Queue is a more advanced analytical queue that assess each element or value based on its priority. Useful in Hospital Emergency room.
 *  - Better than O(n)
 *  - Priority
 *  - Flexible Size
 *  - Fast Inserts
 * 
 * Also another Data structure is Trie - it is used for auto-correct, auto suggestion, wifi routing etc. You are working with Prefixes that connect to a number of words and these words can be accessed without a lot of trouble or work.
