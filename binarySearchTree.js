// Binary Search Tree
/**
 * This type of structure helps preserve relationships between
 * root nodes and child nodes. For example, you know that right and left nodes
 * have different behaviours, right increases and left decreases.
 * @method - Lookup * O(log N) time complexity
 * @method - Insert * O(log N) time complexity
 * @method - Delete * O(log N) time complexity
 * 
 * - Balanced and Unbalanced BST structure # Balanced trees are more efficient 
 *  They give you a better performance compared to an unbalanced search tree.
 * Unbalanced binary search trees tend to Operate on O(N) time complexity. Almost like
 * a linked list. Takes time to Insert or Delete an unbalanced binary search tree.
 * 
 * Pros and Cons of a Binary Search Tree
 * - Better than the O(N) Ordered Flexible Size assuming its a balanced tree.
 * - Downside it has no O(1) operations. Because we have sorted data
 * - BST aren't the fastest for anything, on average Arrays or Object have faster 
 *  operation and some cases where BST's out perform Arrays and Objects.
